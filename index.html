        <p class="animated-text">You are the light of my life, dear.</p>
        <p class="animated-text">Love is not just about words but the silent understanding between two souls. It is the patience to listen, even when nothing is spoken, and the ability to see flaws yet choose to stay and nurture growth. True love thrives on trust, respect, and support, creating a bond that deepens with time. It is about giving without expecting in return, finding joy in the happiness of the other. Love is not about perfection but about embracing imperfections together, growing side by side. During good times and bad times, I want you to know that I will always love you. You must be the happiest on the Earth. Your beauty inside and out can never be explained, your wisdom is unparalleled, and your kindness is incomparable. In the end, it is the strength of connection that defines love, not the absence of struggles.</p>
